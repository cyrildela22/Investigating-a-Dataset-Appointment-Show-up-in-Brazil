# Investigating-a-Dataset-Appointment-Show-up-in-Brazil
## Project Details /Overview
This is the first project of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program and  primarily focuses on conducting data analysis and 
creating a file to share that documents your findings via Python which is documented in a Jupyter Notebook .
The objective of this project is to visually and programmatically assess the Appointment Show up in Brazil dataset
and brainstorming what questions could be answer using it. 
Pandas and NumPy would be used to answer the questions that I find to most interesting, and create a report sharing the answers.
Since this is an open-ended project, the use inferential statistics or machine learning is not required to complete this project
